## Overview

**NeuroOlfactive Intelligence** is a conceptual web application prototype designed to demonstrate how **neuro-olfactive AI**, **biotechnology**, and **immersive digital experiences** can redefine luxury fragrance discovery.

Unlike traditional e-commerce, this platform uses a simulated "biotech" analysis to decode a user's emotional and neurological state, generating a unique, personalized scent profile that bypasses cognitive bias to trigger pure emotion.

### Key Features

*   **🧠 Neuro-Olfactive Analysis**: An interactive "Discovery" module that simulates EEG-based scent matching.
*   **🧬 Unique AI Generation**: A randomized engine (`perfumeEngine.ts`) that creates a *unique* fragrance profile (Name, Accord, Notes, Description) for every session.
*   **💎 Luxury Minimalism**: A high-end, editorial design system using Framer Motion for sophisticated transitions.
*   **🌿 Ethics & Sustainability**: Dedicated sections explaining "Refill-First" logic and "Human-in-the-Loop" AI ethics.
*   **🔮 Future-Ready Tech Stack**: Visualization of conceptual integrations like *Osmobloom™* (biotech extraction) and *ModiFace* (AR).

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework**: [React 19](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (CSS-first configuration)
*   **Animation**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
*   **Routing**: [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/)
*   **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)

## Conceptual Background

This project was designed as a "jury-ready" prototype for an innovation competition. It adheres to strict design guidelines:
*   **Neutral Palette**: Ivory, Charcoal, Muted Gold.
*   **No Gamification**: Serious, scientific, and aspirational tone.
*   **Responsible AI**: Transparent "Explainability" metrics (SHAP-inspired).
